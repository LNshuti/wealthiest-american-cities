# Wealthiest American Cities
Given the growing wealth inequality globally, I found the exercise of studying wealth distribution by geography fascinating. The Growth Lab at Harvard University maintains a [website](https://metroverse.cid.harvard.edu/city/877/overview) with a rich dataset tracking economic indicators of thousands of cities around the globe. This project focuses on American cities, specifically the ten wealthiest cities based on their GPD per capita. To account for distribution, we supplement this data with median household income data from the American Community Survey.
